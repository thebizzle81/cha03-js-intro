              <!-- I wasn't sure at first how exactly the checkBox system would work, but after a lot of online research I found some examples of the checkBox that crossed-over between the HTML and JS files for the project. Ultimately, however, doing the INPUT TYPE CHECKBOX here in the HTML made the most sense  -->

              <!-- I decided to make the smallest password (and default value) at 8 characters, with a max number of characters at 20. However, if the user types in a number higher than 20 in "Length of Password" it will still generate a password of that length. I'm not sure whether this is something I should try and prevent (i.e. limiting all passwords to between 8 and 20 characters) or whether I should leave it as is, giving the user the ability to create passwords with more than 20 characters if that is what they desire. Also, even if the user types in a number higher than 20 for Length of Password, it still includes all symbols that have been checked positively and excludes those that are unchecked (e.g. the user can manually type in 30 for Length of Password, and it will generate a 30-character password, but if the Checkbox called Symbol is unchecked, no Symbols will be included, just as if it was a "correct" password length between 8 and 20 characters. The same goes if the user types in fewer than 8 for Length of Password, all the way down to 1 character) -->
