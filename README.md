## CHA03 Challenge: JavaScript Password Generator  

The Challenge 03: Password Generator project was significantly more difficult in execution than in conception for me. I knew a whole giant bag of tools that could be used in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript worlds, and how they might interact, but figuring out where to start was daunting, other than a tiny bit of source code provided to us.

That being the case, after reviewing the assignment closely, I went out into the internet to see how other people did their own Password Generator at GitHub and other public, open-source sites. Some were decent but were missing one or two things I wanted in my own; some looked good but weren't fully functional or were missing a major part so the generator wouldn't execute as intended; and most were other learners of code struggling themselves with varying degrees of working and non-working code.

At this point, I bookmarked and took notes on the one's I liked either visually or code-wise or both, and started pulling from some as I experimented with different combinations of my own. Ultimately, I decided to do very little styling, because for me a password generator should look and behave in a very utilitarian way. I pulled in a lot of code we weren't given and ignored some of the code we *were* given. In light of this, I might have gone outside the bounds of the assignment in terms of what type of language I used, but in the end I felt it was worth the experience.

## Usage

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![Password Generator](assets/images/pg1.jpg)
    ```
